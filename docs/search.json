I love helping others to grow, especially realizing their hidden potential. When I’m not nerding out things 🧑🏻‍💻, you can find me in the classroom, teaching courses at colleges/universities/group training. Subjects vary: accounting, statistics, data tool stacks, you name it. In addition, I mentor and coach apsiring professionals through various competitions and exam preparations, as well.\nIf you believe I can make your life better in anyways, or if you like exchange ideas, let’s connect! 🤝 You can find me through LinkedIn via the LinkedIn icon at the upper left corner of this page. 😎\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Github",
