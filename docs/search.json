I am a CPA, so by trade, that makes me an accountant.\nThat said, I’m a data nerd, too. Occasionally, I make a bunch of funny names like R, Python, SQL, Excel, Microsoft Fabric (including Power BI), Tableau etc. all dance together so that people can make the best out of their data. People also call me analytics engineer at times. I’m a big in the magic when you mix classic accounting with modern analytics – it’s like peanut butter and jelly, but for business.\nEducation is a BIG deal to me. I love helping others to grow. When I’m not nerding out things, you can find me in the classroom, teaching courses at colleges/universities/professional associations.
