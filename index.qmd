## Warm Greetings!

## More About Me

I am glad that you are interested in me enough to read along here. I am a CPA, so by trade, that makes me an accountant. 👨🏻‍💼💼

That said, I’m a data nerd, too. Occasionally, I make a bunch of funny names like R, Python, SQL, Excel, Microsoft Fabric (including Power BI), Tableau etc. all dance together so that people can make the best out of their data. People also call me analytics engineer at times. I’m a big in the magic when you mix classic accounting with modern analytics – it's like peanut butter and jelly, but for business.

Education is a BIG deal to me. I love helping others to grow, especially realizing their hidden potential. When I’m not nerding out things 🧑🏻‍💻, you can find me in the classroom, teaching courses at colleges/universities/group training. Subjects vary: accounting, statistics, data tool stacks, you name it. In addition, I mentor and coach apsiring professionals through various competitions and exam preparations, as well.

If you believe I can make your life better in anyways, or if you like exchange ideas, let's connect! 🤝 You can find me through LinkedIn via the LinkedIn icon at the upper left corner of this page. 😎
