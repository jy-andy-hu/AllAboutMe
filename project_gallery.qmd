## Welcome

Hello! Here is a collection of my hobby projects done with various tools.

## How Does This Work?

To start with, you will be able to find a list of all my projects. 

There is also a search box that allows you to search by a project name (like Camelot Caves Inc.) or filter by a particular tag (like "Power BI").

Click on any project name will redirect you to view a particular project.

After you are redirected to that project, and if you wish to come back to this page, you can easily do so by clicking the "Go Back" button on your browser. 

Have fun and enjoy!
