## Welcome

Hello! Here is a collection of my educational projects/cotent I developed over time as I taught at different institutions to various audiences. As I said in my welcome message: education üßëüèª‚Äçüè´ has a particular place in my heart... 

Here, you will be able to find out what I have done... and with a lot more to come...

## How Does This Work?

To start with, you will be able to find a list of all my projects. 

There is also a search box that allows you to search by a project name (like Camelot Caves Inc.) or filter by a particular tag (like "Power BI").

Click on any project name will redirect you to view a particular educational project.

After you are redirected to that project, and if you wish to come back to this page, you can easily do so by clicking the "Go Back" button on your browser. 

If you find anything interesting feel free to use them and I hope it can be valuable to you.

If you like what you see and would like to collaborate on or deliver something, feel free to reach out through LinkedIn, right here on this page (upper left corner, LinkedIn logo).

Have fun and enjoy! üòÉ
